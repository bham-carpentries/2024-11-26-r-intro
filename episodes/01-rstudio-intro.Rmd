## Motivation

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and collected
data, the real fun begins with analysis!

Although we could use a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets to analyze our data, these tools are limited in their flexibility and accessibility. Critically, they also are difficult to share steps which explore and change the raw data, which is key to ["reproducible" research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285).

Therefore, this lesson will teach you how to begin exploring your data using R and RStudio. The R program is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and is a freely-available where you downloaded it above. To run R, all you need is the R program.

However, to make using R easier, we will use the program RStudio, which we also downloaded above. RStudio is a free, open-source, Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.


## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

- [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)


## Data Set

We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. We'll use a version of the Palmer Penguins dataset dataset from the [Palmer Penguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) that we have adapted for the purposes of this course. The Palmer Penguins dataset provides morphological measurements (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass) for three penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) collected from three islands (Torgersen, Dream, and Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

Adelie! and Gentoo! by @Allison Horst (CC-BY-4.0)](fig/penguins_ccby4_by_at_allison_horst.png){alt='Meet the penguins cartoon illustration of the penguin species Chinstrap! Adelie! and Gentoo! by @Allison Horst (CC-BY-4.0)'}

Can you read the data into R? Can you plot relationship between bill length and flipper length? Can you calculate the mean body mass of penguins on the island of Dream?
By the end of these lessons you will be able to explore key relationships in the
data in minutes!

## Introduction to RStudio

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for scientific projects that will make your life easier.

**Basic layout**
 
When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

- The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)
- Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![](fig/01-rstudio.png){alt='RStudio layout'}

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![](fig/01-rstudio-script.png){alt='RStudio layout with .R file open'}

## Projects in R Studio

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier.</p>— Vince Buffalo (@vsbuffalo) <a href="https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/323638476153167872">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](fig/bad_layout.png){alt='Screenshot of file manager demonstrating bad project organisation'}

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
  the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
  extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
  things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
  that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

- It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
- It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
  (a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
- It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
- It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

### Creating a self-contained project

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.

We're going to create a new project in RStudio:

1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
2. Click "New Directory".
3. Click "New Project".
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my\_project".
5. If available, select the checkbox for "Create a git repository."
6. Click the "Create Project" button.

### Best practices for project organization

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

#### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

#### Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful.
This task is sometimes called "data munging". Storing these scripts in a
separate folder, and creating a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets can prevent confusion between the two sets.

#### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. Having an output folder
with different sub-directories for each separate analysis makes it easier later.
Since many analyses are exploratory and don't end up being used in the final
project, and some of the analyses get shared between projects.

## Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing

[Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `src` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Use Project Subfolders
Create `data`, `src`, and `results` directories in your project directory.

Copy the files penguins_teaching.csv, weather-data.csv, and weather-data_v2.csv files from the zip file you downloaded as part of the lesson set up to the data/ folder within your project. We will load and use these files later in the course.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Working directory

Knowing R's current working directory is important because when you need to access other files (for example, to import a data file), R will look for them relative to the current working directory.

Each time you create a new RStudio Project, it will create a new directory for that project. When you open an existing `.Rproj` file, it will open that project and set R's working directory to the folder that file is in.

You can check the current working directory with the `getwd()` command, or by using the menus in RStudio.

1. In the console, type `getwd()` ("wd" is short for "working directory") and hit Enter.
2. In the Files pane, double click on the `data` folder to open it (or navigate to any other folder you wish). To get the Files pane back to the current working directory, click "More" and then select "Go To Working Directory".

You can change the working directory with `setwd()`, or by using RStudio menus.

1. In the console, type `setwd("data")` and hit Enter. Type `getwd()` and hit Enter to see the new working directory.
2. In the menus at the top of the RStudio window, click the "Session" menu button, and then select "Set Working Directory" and then "Choose Directory". Next, in the windows navigator that opens, navigate back to the project directory, and click "Open". Note that a `setwd` command will automatically appear in the console.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Workflow within RStudio

There are two main ways one can work within RStudio:

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
  - This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
  - It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
  - This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
  - You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
or using R's `source()`  function.

In this lesson we'll spend a lot of time working in the interactive console.
We'll move on to creating scripts in the next lesson. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Running segments of your code

RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
current line, you can

1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or
2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or
3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux
or <kbd>⌘</kbd>\+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
(This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
including the modifications you have made.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## R scripts

Any commands that you write in the R console can be saved to a file
to be re-run again.  Files containing R code to be run in this way are
called R scripts.  R scripts have `.R` at the end of their names to
let you know what they are.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is to do arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". [1] is the index of
the first element of the line being printed in the console. 

If you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it. If you are familiar with Unix Shell's bash, you may recognize this behavior from bash.

```r
> 1 +
```

```output
+
```

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> and RStudio will give you back the ">" prompt.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Canceling commands

If you're using R from the command line instead of from within RStudio,
you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!

Canceling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
currently writing.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

- Parentheses: `(`, `)`
- Exponents: `^` or `**`
- Multiply: `*`
- Divide: `/`
- Add: `+`
- Subtract: `-`

```{r}
3 + 5 * 2
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.

```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```

The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we can type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses.
Functions take arguments as inputs, anything we type inside the parentheses of a function is considered an argument. Depending on the function, the number of arguments can vary from none to multiple. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd() #returns an absolute filepath
```

doesn't require an argument, whereas for the next set of mathematical functions we will need to supply the function a value in order to compute the result.

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r}
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
```

```{r}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. When using RStudio, this will open the 'Help' pane;
if using R in the terminal, the help page will open in your browser.
The help page will include a detailed description of the command and
how it works. Scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually
show a collection of code examples which illustrate command usage.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{r}
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{r}
1 > 0  # greater than
```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Comparing Numbers

A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should
never use `==` to compare two numbers unless they are
integers (a data type which can specifically represent
only whole numbers).

Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a
certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look
the same when printed out by R, may actually have
different underlying representations and therefore be
different by a small margin of error (called Machine
numeric tolerance).

Instead you should use the `all.equal` function.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r}
x
```

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in the top right panel of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r}
log(x)
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods but no spaces. They
must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore).
Variables beginning with a period are hidden variables.
Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include

- periods.between.words
- underscores\_between\_words
- camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. A vector is 1 dimensional array of ordered values all of the same data type. For example:

```{r}
1:5
```

We can assign a vector to a variable:

```{r}
x <- 5:10
```

We can apply functions to all the elements of a vector:

```{r}
(1:5) * 2
2^(1:5)
```

We can also create vectors "by hand" using the `c()` function; this tersely named function is used to _combine_ values into a vector; these values can, themselves, be vectors:

```{r}
c(2, 4, -1)
c(x, 2, 2, 3)
```

Vectors aren't limited to storing numbers:

```{r}
c("a", "b", "c", "def")
```

R comes with a few built in constants, containing useful values:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
LETTERS
letters
month.abb
month.name
```

We will use some of these in the examples that follow.

### Vector lengths

We can calculate how many elements a vector contains using the `length()` function:

```{r}
length(x)
length(letters)
```


### Subsetting vectors

Having defined a vector, it's often useful to _extract_ parts of a vector.   We do this with the
`[]` operator.  Using the built in `month.name` vector:

```{r}
month.name[2]
month.name[2:4]
```

Let's unpick the second example; `2:4` generates the sequence 2,3,4.   This gets passed to the 
extract operator `[]`.   We can also generate this sequence using the `c()` function:

```{r}
month.name[c(2,3,4)]
```

:::::::::::::: callout
## Vector numbering in R starts at 1

In many programming languages (C and python, for example), the first
element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1.
::::::::::::::

Values are returned in the order that we specify the indices.  We can extract the same element more 
than once:

```{r}
month.name[4:2]
month.name[c(1,1,2,3,4)]
```

If we try and extract an element that doesn't exist in the vector, the missing values are `NA`:

```{r}
month.name[10:13]
```

:::::::::::::::::::: callout
## Missing data

`NA` is a special value, that is used to represent "not available", or "missing".  If we perform computations which include `NA`, the result is usually `NA`:

```{r}
1 + NA
```

This raises an interesting point; how do we test if a value is `NA`?  This doesn't work:

```{r}
x <- NA
x == NA
```

## Handling special values

There are a number of special functions you can use to handle missing data, and other special values:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA`.
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

::::::::::::::::::::

### Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:

```{r}
month.name[-2]
```

We can skip multiple elements:

```{r}
month.name[c(-1, -5)]  # or month.name[-c(1,5)]
```

:::::::::::::::::::: callout
## Tip: Order of operations

A common error occurs when trying to skip
slices of a vector. Most people first try to negate a
sequence like so:

```{r, error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
month.name[-1:3]
```

This gives a somewhat cryptic error:

```{r, error=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
month.name[-1:3]
```

But remember the order of operations. `:` is really a function, so
what happens is it takes its first argument as -1, and second as 3,
so generates the sequence of numbers: `-1, 0, 1, 2, 3`.

The correct solution is to wrap that function call in brackets, so
that the `-` operator is applied to the sequence:

```{r}
-(1:3)
month.name[-(1:3)]
```
::::::::::::::::::::

### Subsetting with logical vectors 

As well as providing a list of indices we want to keep (or delete, if we prefix them with `-`), we 
can pass a _logical vector_ to R indicating the indices we wish to select:

```{r}
fourmonths <- month.name[1:4]
fourmonths

fourmonths[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

What happens if we supply a logical vector that is shorter than the vector we're extracting the elements from?

```{r}
fourmonths[c(TRUE,FALSE)]
```

This illustrates the idea of _vector recycling_; the `[]` extract operator "recycles" the subsetting vector:

```{r}
fourmonths[c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)]
```

This can be useful, but can easily catch you out.

The idea of selecting elements of a vector using a logical subsetting vector may seem a bit esoteric, and a lot more
typing than just selecting the elements you want by index.  It becomes really useful when we write code to generate
the logical vector:

```{r}
my_vector <- c(0.01, 0.69, 0.51, 0.39)
my_vector > 0.5
my_vector[my_vector > 0.5]
```

:::::::::::: callout
## Tip: Combining logical conditions

There are many situations in which you will wish to combine multiple logical
criteria. For example, we might want to find all the elements that are 
between two values. Several operations for combining logical vectors exist in R:

+ `&`, the "logical AND" operator: returns `TRUE` if both the left and right
  are `TRUE`.
+ `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right
  (or both) are `TRUE`.

The recycling rule applies with both of these, so `TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`
will compare the first `TRUE` on the left of the `&` sign with each of the
three conditions on the right.

You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These operators
do not use the recycling rule: they only look at the first element of each
vector and ignore the remaining elements. The longer operators are mainly used
in programming, rather than data analysis.

+ `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to
  `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (e.g. `!TRUE` becomes
  `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(e.g. `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes
  `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).

Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the
`all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`)
and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the
vector are `TRUE`).

## Challenge 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
min_depth
max.depth
_region
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
15Ndelta
celsius2kelvin
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 1

The following can be used as R variables:

```{r ch1pt1-sol, eval=FALSE}
min_depth
max.depth
MaxLength
celsius2kelvin
```

The following creates a hidden variable:

```{r ch1pt2-sol, eval=FALSE}
.mass
```

The following will not be able to be used to create a variable

```{r ch1pt3-sol, eval=FALSE}
_region
min-length
15Ndelta
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 2

What will be the value of each variable  after each
statement in the following program?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mass <- 47.5
depth <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
depth <- depth - 20
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 2

```{r ch2pt1-sol}
mass <- 47.5
```

This will give a value of `r mass` for the variable mass

```{r ch2pt2-sol}
depth <- 122
```

This will give a value of `r depth` for the variable depth

```{r ch2pt3-sol}
mass <- mass * 2.3
```

This will multiply the existing value of `r mass/2.3` by 2.3 to give a new value of
`r mass` to the variable mass.

```{r ch2pt4-sol}
depth <- depth - 20
```

This will subtract 20 from the existing value of `r depth + 20 ` to give a new value
of `r depth` to the variable depth.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to
compare mass to depth. Is mass larger than depth?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 3

One way of answering this question in R is to use the `>` to set up the following:

```{r ch3-sol}
mass > depth
```

This should yield a boolean value of TRUE since `r mass` is greater than `r depth`.

## Solution to challenge 4
We can extract the elements in reverse order by generating the sequence
26, 25, ... 1 using the `:` operator:

```{r}
letters[26:1]
```

Although this works, it makes the assumption that `letters` will always be length 26.
Although this is probably a safe assumption in English, other
languages may have more (or fewer) letters in their alphabet.   It is good
practice to avoid assuming _anything_ about your data.

We can avoid assuming `letters` is length 26, by using the `length()` function:

```{r}
letters[length(letters):1]
```

## Challenge 5

Given the following code:

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 7.5, 4.8)
x
```

Come up with at least 3 different commands that will produce the following output:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x[2:4]
```

After you find 3 different commands, compare notes with your neighbour. Did you have different strategies?

## Solution to challenge 5

```{r}
x[2:4]
```
```{r}
x[-c(1,5)]
```
```{r}
x[c(2,3,4)]
```


```{r}
x[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

(We can use vector recycling to make the previous example slightly shorter:
```{r}
 x[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```
 The first element of the logical vector will be recycled)

We can construct a logical test to generate the logical vector:
```{r}
x[x > 6]
```
Unpicking this example, `x > 6` generates the logical vector:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x > 6
```

Which is passed to the `[ ]` subsetting operator.
